The structure of our code:

In the src folder, we stored the provided serial version into serial.cu, and stored all the GPU kernels in kernels.cu

In main.cu, we use forward_operation_parallel to execute all the layers. All the memory allocation, and kernel launching happen inside this function.

There's two more host function in main.cu. They are both designed for easy launching matrix unrolled version of convolution layer.

/src also contained query.cu and tests.cu, which are only used in the early stage of our development, and can be safely ignored.
